# Hello! I am Rafa≈Ç

I am a Fullstack Developer with over 8 years of commercial experience in building and scaling web applications. My main expertise lies in **Node.js, React, Next.js and relational/no-SQL databases**, but I also work with **Elixir/Phoenix**, which gave me a strong understanding of concurrency, fault tolerance, and distributed systems. I enjoy solving complex technical problems and designing systems that are robust, maintainable, and secure.  

I have worked as a **Tech Leader and Software Architect**, making decisions that shaped products and mentoring developers to raise the technical bar within teams. My experience spans **databases** (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis), **messaging systems** (RabbitMQ, Kafka), and **cloud-native practices** with Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and monitoring.  

I am passionate about **software architecture and system design**, always looking for ways to optimize performance and scalability. I value clean code, consistency, and reusability, which is why I put emphasis on strong typing, functional programming concepts, and thoughtful abstractions. Outside of commercial work, I explore new technologies through side projects and write a programming blog to share my knowledge.
