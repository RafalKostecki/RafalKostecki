# About Me

I am a fullstack developer with over 8 years of experience in building and scaling web applications. My daily work involves Node.js, React, and Next.js, but I also enjoy exploring functional programming and concurrency with Elixir and Phoenix. I am particularly interested in system design, distributed architectures, and creating solutions that are robust, maintainable, and secure.
